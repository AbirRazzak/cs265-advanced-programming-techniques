1-1) Typically the value of 0 is assigned to False and the value of 1 to be assigned to true. Also the variable 'not-eof' is very confusing. Instead try reversing the meaning behind the variable to is-eof or soemthing similar.

No need to be returning pointers as pointers are automatically assigned when changed

enums aren't nessessary here.

Comment #1, claims a void function is returning something
Comment #2 is completely wrong, doesnt even check for even numbers, and no mention about MAX either
